When the user opens the app on their tablets the app will automatically display cells in a larger font, resulting in the words in each cell being displayed in a larger and more convenient manner. Language learners who would like to use the sudoku app on their tablets will not have difficulty reading longer words because of the bigger size of the fonts on the screen.
