## Tablet User
> As a language learner practing at home, I want sudoku game to adjust its font size so it is better displayed for my tablets larger screen

When the user opens the app on their tablets the app will automatically display cells in a larger font, resulting in the words in each cell being displayed in a larger and more convenient manner. Language learners who would like to use the sudoku app on their tablets will not have difficulty reading longer words because of the bigger size of the fonts on the screen.

> As a vocabulary learner taking the bus, I want to use my phone in landscape mode for Sudoku vocabulary practice, so that longer words are displayed in a larger font than standard mode.

For language learner users who prefer to use landscape mode, the app will detect the orientation of the user's device and accordingly, display some words(longer ones)in a more convenient(larger)font.
