## User Stories Worked for Iteration 3

> As a teacher of elementary and junior high school children, I want scaled versions of Sudoku that use 4x4 and 6x6 grids. In the 6x6 grid version, the overall grid should be divided into rectangles of six cells each (2x3).



>As a vocabulary learner who wants an extra challenging mode, I want a 12x12 version of Sudoku to play on my tablet. The overall grid should be divided into rectangles of 12 cells each (3x4).
