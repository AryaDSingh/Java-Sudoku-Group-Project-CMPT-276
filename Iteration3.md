## User Stories Worked for Iteration 3

> As a teacher of elementary and junior high school children, I want scaled versions of Sudoku that use 4x4 and 6x6 grids. In the 6x6 grid version, the overall grid should be divided into rectangles of six cells each (2x3).

When the user opens the app on their tablets the app will automatically display cells in a larger font, resulting in the words in each cell being displayed in a larger and more convenient manner. Language learners who would like to use the sudoku app on their tablets will not have difficulty reading longer words because of the bigger size of the fonts on the screen.



>As a vocabulary learner who wants an extra challenging mode, I want a 12x12 version of Sudoku to play on my tablet. The overall grid should be divided into rectangles of 12 cells each (3x4).

For language learner users who prefer to use landscape mode, the app will detect the orientation of the user's device and accordingly, display some words(longer ones)in a more convenient(larger)font.
